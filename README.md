deep learning method in Vehicle Detection and Counting implementation 

It's an implementation of the open access journal of Vehicle Detection and Counting in High-Resolution Aerial Images Using Convolutional Regression Neural Network. for data set MunichDatasetVehicleDetection-2015-old coded and whit some small changes can use for OIRDS_v1_0 data set.so I did it for myself and share it whit others interested.
